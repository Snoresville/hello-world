My First Repository

Hi, my username is Snoresville.
This is my first repository on GitHub, and I look forward to using it frequently with collaborative projects, and likewise with self-projects.

GitHub is useful for keeping track with changes, and project versions can easily be changed if errors are apparent in later builds.
This is why I am enthusiastic with using GitHub!
